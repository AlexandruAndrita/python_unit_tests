The test created for this assignment are slightly different. <br/><br/>

They are created using ```Python's doctest```. <br/>
However, the test should be run in a slightly similiar way: <br/>
[ 1 ] using the command ```python -m doctest <name_of_file>.py``` (in case one wants to see only if the tests passed - in that case, nothing will be shown - or if the
      tests failed - in that case the failed test will be shown)<br/>
[ 2 ] using the comannd ```python -m doctest -v <name_of_file>.py``` (in case one wants to see the tests and how many passed and how many failed) <br/><br/>
