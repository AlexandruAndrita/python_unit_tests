| The test created for this assignment are slightly different.
|
| They are created using ``Python's doctest``.
|
| However, the test should be run in a slightly similiar way. There are two different possibilities:
| [ 1 ] using the command ``python -m doctest <name_of_file>.py`` (in case one wants to see only if the tests passed, in that case, nothing will be shown or if the tests failed, in that case the failed test(s) will be shown)
| [ 2 ] using the comannd ``python -m doctest -v <name_of_file>.py`` (in case one wants to see the tests and how many passed and how many failed)
