[@python_unit_tests](https://github.com/AlexandruAndrita/python_unit_tests "python_unit_tests") contains the unit tests I have written for my homework<br/><br/>

As for now, I have the unit tests only for the 4<sup>th</sup> assignment, but the other ones will be added in due course.<br/>
Moreover, the way these tests can be used will be provided soon.<br/>
More details are about to come soon...
