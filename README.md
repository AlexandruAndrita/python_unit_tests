[@python_unit_tests](https://github.com/AlexandruAndrita/python_unit_tests "python_unit_tests") contains the unit tests I have written for my homework<br/><br/>

The unit tests will be added gradually along each homework added in the [@python_assignments](https://github.com/AlexandruAndrita/python_assignments "pyhton_assignments"). <br/><br/>

:test_tube: The test could be run through the command line, following these steps: <br/>
[ 1 ] The command line path should indicate the folder where the unit test is located.<br/>
[ 2 ] The test file should be called like this: ```python unit_test_name.py```<br/><br/>

If the result is a ```.``` (dot), then the test has passed :heavy_check_mark: . Otherwise, an ```F``` will be displayed :x:. <br/><br/>

More details are about to come soon...
